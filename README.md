# lopestalk-backend
LopesTalk's backend is built using SpringBoot, a Java-based framework, and provides essential functionality for the app. It uses public APIs to provide users with motivational quotes, as well as custom APIs for user registration and login, generating Journey Paths, and managing tasks using CRUD functionality. With its robust architecture and streamlined design, the LopesTalk backend enables seamless integration with the frontend and helps provide a smooth user experience.
